This is my version of the project that I completed entirely on my own. It involved several
hours of reading stackoverflow and other documentation to perform everything necessary
to make this project functional.

While this project is not perfect (we could improve it
by displaying a "please wait a moment" alert if they tried to click the button before the 
API call concluded or by making the styling of this project more attractive. Overall, however,
I'm proud of what I've created here.

Instead of trying to make everything perfect, I'm going to continue building more projects
to become more comfortable with making things functional in a reasonable timeframe. I think
that's what will make me employable.

It would of course be ideal to do everything perfectly (or close to it) on my own, and I
will aspire towards that. For now, however, I'm going to acknowledge that if I was working
on a team, getting a project to this point would probably be satisfactory and that I could
ask a more senior developer or CSS pro how to tidy up the last few touches before shipping
it to the client.
