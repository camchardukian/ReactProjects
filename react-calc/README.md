This is a simple calculator I built outside of my 9-5 developer job to get more comfortable with React Hooks.

I'm currently (May 2020) in the process of building a better calculator using Hooks and TypeScript [here](https://github.com/camchardukian/fcc-react-typescript-calculator). If you're reading this beyond May 2020, my TypeScript calculator is probably already finished.
